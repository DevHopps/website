As a preparation for the next Ludum Dare, which is happening on the weekend, I made a small prototype with the stuff I am probably going to use.

It’s build with LibGDX using Box2D and Box2DLights. You can have a look at the [Git repository][git]. There is also a binary included at the releases tab.

This is however no game, you can just move the light. I didn’t have too much time to make something bigger.
