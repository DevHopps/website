I feel it’s time for a little update on my ants because pretty much everything changed.

As you can see above, they are now in a somewhat natural looking nest. I needed to forcefully move them there after the test-tube began to mildew. However I can now safely say that everyone survived that.

The population is also growing really good, I estimate 60-70 ants with more coming as I see enough brood.

I leave you with a close-up of the queen (Notice my great placement of the adhesive tape):

I know it is hard to see, because there are too many ants in front of the queen. Maybe this will help:

![Image]({{ '/assets/images/ants02.png' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})

You are probably also asking why these images are so red? There is a red foil in front of the glass, because ants can apparently not see red light, so it’s pretty dark (no foil can be perfect) in there for them.

I am additionally already prepared for hibernation, but I will update you once the time has come for that!
