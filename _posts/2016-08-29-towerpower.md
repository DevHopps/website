I did it guys and gals! I did indeed take some time for the 36th (Ludum Dare)[ludumdare] and finished a f*ing game again. 
As a reference: the last game I did for Ludum Dare was “(10 Seconds Jump)[10secondsjump]” 3(!) years ago. 
I'm quite happy about participating and finishing the game. 

The game itself isn't great, and I would've had enough time to add more stuff theoretically - but I felt like it 
wouldn't really fix things. I'll do a post-mortem soon.

Until then you can get (more info on the game on the Ludum Dare page and download it from there)[game].
