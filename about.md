Hi, I am Benedict Balzer, a computer science student based in Germany.
I am part time working on web stuff for a medium sized company, mostly
using PHP, SQL, JS, HTML and CSS.

In my free time I like to develop games, which this website is mostly about.
In the past I usally wrote these games in Java, but I like to experiment with
HTML5 and Javascript and currently write a small-ish game using Electron.

I also love ants, which you mostly notice when I post some cool pictures of them!
