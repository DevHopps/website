                    <p>
                        I decided to keep developing my Ludum Dare game <a href="https://hopps.me/ludum-dare/gamedev/2016/08/29/towerpower/">Tower Power</a>, because there are <a href="https://hopps.me/ludum-dare/gamedev/2016/08/30/towerpower-postmortem/"> many things</a> to fix and improve.
                        Instead of Java, I will use HTML5 though.

                    <p>Although it is already online, I have some things I want to improve, so I will over time. One of the things I want to add is a better project overview.</p>
